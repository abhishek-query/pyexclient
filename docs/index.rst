pyexclient documentation
=================================

`Expel <https://www.expel.io>`_ is a technology company that built a platform (Expel Workbench) to enable delivery of our 24x7 Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service delivery. The Expel Workbench platform is used by both analysts and customers to communicate, triage, investigate and remediate incidents. 

When Expel was founded, we had the goal of making our platform “flypaper for inventors.”  What this means is that, if you have an idea, you should be able to safely test it out on top of our platform using existing technology levers (in this case APIs). 

The Expel Workbench is `JSON API compliant <https://jsonapi.org/>`_ and uses swagger for API specification/documentation. You can find Expel’s swagger doc `here <https://workbench.expel.io/api/v2/docs/>`_. Pyexclient is the pythonification of the JSON API spec. The pyexclient client code, and much of the documentation, is auto generated from swagger spec file.
